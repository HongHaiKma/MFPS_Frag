<section id="create_new_level">
	<div class="page-header"><h3>Create new level</h3><hr class="notop"></div>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	If you want add a map / scene for play, this is really simply, you only need add some prefabs to your ready made design map.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Video tutorial:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XabR4NGgJRI&amp;t=191s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XabR4NGgJRI&amp;t=191s</a></p>
<p>
	<strong>1 - Design your level</strong></p>
<p>
	- You can create a new scene and design the level or if you already have a map done simple create a prefab of it,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	add all the require object as child of 1 parent for make only 1 prefab, example: create a new GameObject in hierarchy called &quot;Environment&quot; and put inside it all other models, prefabs, lights, etc... and make a prefab of it.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>2 - Duplicate example level</strong></p>
<p>
	This is a simple way to create a new level to work with MFPS, instead of add all the MFPS 2.0 in your scene map, simple add your design map to a duplicate working scene of MFPS, for this go to (Project View): MFPS -&gt; Scenes -&gt; ExampleLevel&nbsp;- duplicate this, select the scene in project view and press Ctrl + D (on windows), open the new duplicate scene &quot;ExampleLevel 1&quot;.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>3 - Add you map prefab</strong></p>
<p>
	In the new scene (duplicated) delete the game object called &quot;Environment&quot;:</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_8.png" style="width: 487px; height: 159px;"></p>
<p>
	and add your map design prefab that you create before.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>4 - Create Spawn Points</strong></p>
<p>
	After you add you map you will need also create&nbsp; spawn points and move some things, for create spawn point simple create a new game object in hierarchy:</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_25.png" style="width: 258px; height: 379px;"></p>
<p>
	and add &quot;bl_SpawnPoint&quot; script on it:</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_12.png" style="width: 490px; height: 214px;"></p>
<p>
	positioned that spawn point in your map and assign for what team is:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_10.png" style="width: 1615px; height: 677px;"></p>
<p>
	5 - Save the scene</p>
<p>
	After you finish with the spawn points, save the scene and add it to the &#39;Build Settings&#39;, then go to &#39;MainMenu&#39; scene and in Lobby -&gt; bl_Lobby script in the &#39;Level Manager&#39; section you will see a list, add a new field on this list and&nbsp; fill the info:</p>
<p>
	<strong>Name:</strong> The name to display in room list this can be wherever you want called it.</p>
<p>
	<strong>SceneName:</strong> This is the real name of scene, the same as apear in build settings, this is internal use only.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Preview:</strong> a sprite preview of map.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_16.png" style="width: 479px; height: 436px;"></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	6 - Finally you need bake a &quot;<strong>Navmesh</strong>&quot; for this scene in order to the bots can move around the map, if you don&#39;t know how to do it, check the offical unity tutorial:</p>

	Model and Animations set as Humanoid</p>
<p>
	Ragdoll prefab of the player model.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<p>
	Since Beta 5 player prefabs are assigned in &#39;GameData&#39; (in Resources folder) instead of bl_GameManager.</p>

<section id="add_weapons">
	<div class="page-header"><h3>Add Weapons</h3><hr class="notop"></div>
<p>
	If you want add a new weapons:</p>
<div class="alert">
	<strong>NOTE</strong>: Since version 1.4 of MFPS there is a new&nbsp; in editor tutorial for add weapons, check (in Editor)<em>MFPS -&gt; Tutorials -&gt; Add Weapon</em>.</div>
<h2>
	1 - Create the weapon info:</h2>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_34.png" style="width: 747px; height: 846px;"></p>
<p>
	- Go to GameData (in Resources folder) in &quot;Weapons&quot; section is a list called &quot;All Weapons&quot;, Add a new field to this list</p>
<p>
	and filled the information of this new weapons Where:</p>
<p>
	Name = The name that will be show in UI and kill feed.</p>
<p>
	Type = what type of weapon is this?</p>
<p>
	Settings = the statistics of weapon</p>
<p>
	PickUp Prefab = the weapon that will be throwed when pick up other gun, you should create this.</p>
<p>
	Gun Icon = the icon of this weapon.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	<strong>2 - Add the weapon to the player</strong></h2>
<p>
	- Now that we have the info of new weapon, we need add the weapon model to the players, for it drag one of player prefabs (from Resources folder, note that you need do this for each player prefabs) in hierarchy, open it and go to <em>MPlayer -&gt; Heat -&gt; Mouse -&gt; Animation -&gt; Main Camer -&gt; Weapon Camera -&gt; TilEffect -&gt; WeaponManger -&gt; *</em> here you will see all the weapons (as children of Weapon Manager), duplicate one of these as recomendation duplicate one of the same type of weapons that is your new weapons example if your new weapons is a rifle duplicate the rifle so save a litle work.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_9.png" style="width: 965px; height: 911px;"></p>
<p>
	in the new duplicated weapon change the information of bl_Gun script attached:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;<strong>Gun ID</strong> = select the name of new gun that you created before (note that this list is not the same as the weapon type, is the list of weapon info from GameData)</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aim Position</strong> = <em>(do this after add the new model)</em> for get this you need move the new weapon (Rifle (1) in the image) from editor and put right in the center copy the position from inspector and paste in bl_Gun then set the weapon again to the default position.</p>
<p>
	<strong>FirePoint </strong>= Create a new Game Object under the new weapon and put it exactly in the front of barrel of weapon (is not require if the weapon is a knife) and put this new object in the &quot;Fire Point&quot; variable.</p>
<p>
	<strong>SoundsReloadByAnimation </strong>= set true only if you play the sounds by animation event, set false if you want assign the sounds by script.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	<strong>3 - Change Weapon Model</strong></h2>
<p>
	Now we need replace the weapon model, due the duplicated still contain the model of duplicated weapons we need delect this but before delecte we need save the muzzle flash, click in the muzzleflash in bl_Gun and drag out side of weapon model that we will delete, then delect the model.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="[img]assets/images/image_5.gif[/img]"></p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_5.gif"></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	- Now drag you new weapon model under the the new weapon object (Rifle (1)), be sure that your new model is market as Legacy mode in Animartion type, reset the position of model under the parent (Rifle (1)) to be position = 0,0,0 and rotation = 0,0,0.</p>
<p>
	- Now move the Rifle (1) (not the model) to be in front of camera where you want to the default position will be.</p>
<p>
	- in the new model under Rifle (1) (where Animation component is attached) add these scripts: bl_WeaponAnim.cs and bl_WeaponMovement.cs:</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_30.png" style="width: 976px; height: 927px;"></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	- Now in bl_WeaponMovement we need add the position and rotation that the weapon will lerp when the player run, fot this we need do the same as we obtain the position for Aim but the difference is that now we need move the model (where bl_WeaponMovement is attached) and not the parent (where bl_Gun is attached).</p>
<p>
	so simple positioned the weapon model in the position and rotation that will be when player run, then copy the position and rotation and paste in the respective varaiable: position = Move To, Rotation = Rotate To, then simple set again the weapon model to position = 0,0,0 and rotation to 0,0,0.</p>
<p>
	Finally set the MuzzleFlash and Cartrige particles under the weapon model, be sure that none of bl_Gun is missing, also change the &quot;Rifle (1)&quot; place holder name to your custom name.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	4 - Listed Weapon in Weapon Manager</h2>
<p>
	- For finish the integration we need listed this new weapon (bl_Gun) in the &quot;All Weapon&quot; list of bl_GunManager.cs: simple go to WeaponManager -&gt; bl_GunManager -&gt; AllWeapons -&gt;&nbsp; in this list add a new field and add the new weapon.</p>
<p>
	- Now assign the weapon to one of the four player clases, simple set the index of new weapon in AllWeapons list in one of four slots of one of these classes:</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_32.gif"></p>
<p>
	Now you have a new weapon!</p>
</section>
<section id="remote_weapons">
	<div class="page-header"><h3>Remote Weapons</h3><hr class="notop"></div>
<p>	When you add a new weapon to a player you also set the model that show in the hands of player model, as FPS game there are two weapons views:</p>
<p>	1 - Which the local player see the &#39;First Person Weapon&#39;</p>
<p>	2 - Which other players see in the player model hands &#39;Third Person Weapon&#39;.</p>
<p>	&nbsp;</p>
<p>	This tutorial is for how add the second one &#39;Third Person Weapon&#39; after you already add the First person one.</p>
<p>	&nbsp;</p>
<p>	- You need the same weapon model as in the First person view but without the hands model, just the weapon mesh.</p>
<p>	- Go to the &#39;RemoteGuns&#39; game object (in hierarchy) that is located under the <strong>Right Hand </strong>bone of player model and put the new weapon mesh under this:<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_37.gif"></p>
<p>	- Now positioned the weapon right as you want to look in the hands of player mode:</p>
<p>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_39.gif"></p>
<p>	now in the new weapon model add the script &#39;<strong>bl_NetworkGun.cs</strong>&#39;, now you will see that appear a field called &quot;<strong>Local Weapon</strong>&quot; in this field you need drag the &#39;First Person Weapon&#39; of this gun, the one that you should have added before from the &#39;<strong>Add Weapon</strong>&#39; tutorial:</p>
<p>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_20.png" style="width: 758px; height: 719px;"></p>
<p>	- Now depend of type of weapon a few new variables will appear,</p>
<p>	<strong>Bullet:</strong> (Optional) here you can add a bullet to override the local one, if you leave null the bullet from the First Person Weapon will be used.</p>
<p>	<strong>MuzzleFlash:&nbsp;</strong>here the particle system (not prefab) that will play when weapon fire is called, the particle system should be under the weapon mesh.</p>
<p>	<strong>Left Hand Position:</strong> from version 1.1 left hand position is controlled by IK to achieve a better effect and more realistic kinematic, for use this feature you simple need set up the position:</p>
<p>	&nbsp;- in the bl_NetworkGun script click on the button &quot;SetUp Hand IK&quot; or &quot;Edit Hand Position&quot;, after click this will automatically select a object and the player IK will start run in editor, so all what you need to do is positioned the selected object to the position where will be in the barrel of the weapon:</p>
<p>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_18.gif"></p>
<p>	After you finish you need close the IK runner window, simple click on the button of the little window and ready.</p>
<p>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_28.png" style="width: 201px; height: 74px;"></p>
<p>	- Now you need add this weapon to the Network weapon list, add a new field in the list<strong> &#39;Network Guns&#39;</strong> of <em>bl_PlayerSync.cs</em> and drag the weapon here:</p>
<p>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_38.gif" style="width: 793px; height: 650px;"></p>
<p>	Ready!</p>
</section>
<section id="weapon_pickup">
	<div class="page-header"><h3>Weapon PickUp</h3><hr class="notop"></div>
<p>	After add a local and remote weapon you also need create a prefab which will throw when die or that can be pick up:</p>
<p>	- as Third Person Weapon you only need the weapon mesh without the hand model</p>
<p>	- Add the script bl_GunPickUp.cs and select the correct &#39;Gun ID&#39;, in the info set the default ammo that this weapon contain.</p>
<p>	- Add also a Sphere Collider as <strong>Trigger </strong>and a Box Colider (<strong>Trigger as false</strong>), the Box Collider should fit the weapon bounds limits and the Sphere Collider Trigger represent the are where players will detect this weapon for pick up.</p>
<p>	- Now set the Layer of this as <strong>&#39;Ignore Raycast&#39;&nbsp;</strong>and create a prefab of this:</p>
<p>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_13.png" style="width: 1661px; height: 591px;"></p>
<p>	- Finally go to the weapon info of this gun in &#39;GameData&#39; and assign the prefab to the pick up field:</p>
<p>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_11.png" style="width: 488px; height: 526px;"></p>
<p>	- Ready!.</p>
</section>
<section id="hands_textures">
	<div class="page-header"><h3>Hands Textures</h3><hr class="notop"></div>
<p>	Normally the player model of each team have different texture and also the first person hands have different textures, so for this there are a easy method in MFPS for you don&#39;t need apply that texture in each weapon for each player, what you only need is that all weapons for each player shared the same hands material.</p>
<p>	so then you need do this:</p>
<p>	&nbsp;</p>
<p>	1 -&nbsp; go to the player prefab -&gt; bl_PlayerSettings -&gt; Hands -&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_15.png" style="width: 495px; height: 743px;"></p>
<p>	here you need set the material for hands and sleves (if needed) and also the texture for each player hand,</p>
<p>	in the bottom are a option &#39;Use Effect&#39; this enable a blinking effect after player spawn for 5 seconds, the colors are between the blink effect will do.</p>
<p>	&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="player_animations">
	<div class="page-header"><h3>Player Animations</h3><hr class="notop"></div>
<p>	MFPS 2.0 use Mecanim for player animation so change animations clips is really simple as drag and drop, you only need a humanoid animation clip and the assign in the Animator controller:</p>
<p>	1 - Locate the required animation</p>
<p>	- First to all you need find the animation that you want replace, example you want change the &quot;Rifle Reload&quot; animation,</p>
<p>	you need find it in the player Animator Controller tree view, go to (Project View) MFPS -&gt; Content -&gt; Art -&gt; Animations -&gt; Player -&gt;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_6.png" style="width: 481px; height: 293px;"></p>
<p>	With the Animator Controller select, open the Animator Window (Window -&gt; Animator), on the Animator view you need figure for what part of player body is this animations Bottom or Up body (Lens or Arms), example &quot;Rifle Reload&quot; is for Arms so is for Upper Body, go to &quot;Layers&quot; - and select &quot;Upper&quot; layer, there you will see various state machine with the name of the weapon to which it belongs, select the weapon:</p>
<p>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_27.png" style="width: 944px; height: 429px;">double click on the state machine &quot;Rifle&quot; and you will see other states that represent the weapon state, as this example we are looking for &quot;Reload&quot; state, select the Reload state and in the inspector view you will see the settings of this state&nbsp;specifically the &quot;Motion&quot; field, in this we need drag / replace the animation clip with the new one:</p>
<p>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_14.png" style="width: 1445px; height: 325px;">ready, you have replace the animation, for all other animations is the same steps, you also can play with other settings of states like speed, trasittion time, etc... you may need have basic knowledge of Mecanim for not break the tree system.</p>
</section>
<section id="ai">
	<div class="page-header"><h3>AI</h3><hr class="notop"></div>
<p>
	In version 1.1 we introduce a AI agent with shooter behaviour, we this player can play a match with bots and other players, this is essential when there are not enough real players.</p>
<p>
	the AI is synchronize over network, can kill real players and other bots as well, they can fire with rifle and throw grenades to the target, also there is a simple but useful &#39;Safe Point / Cover Point&#39; system, that help bots cover in certain situations.</p>
<h2>
	How to play:</h2>
<p>
	- At the moment the party with bots is only available on FFA mode, when you select the FFA game mode in the lobby a toggle called &quot;with bots&quot; will appear, select this to add bots to the match or not.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	Number of Bots:</h2>
<p>
	- for default an party have 6 bots as maximun but you can add or remove some, for change this simple go to MFPS -&gt; Content -&gt; Prefabs -&gt; GamePlay -&gt; AIManager -&gt; this prefab have attached a bl_AIManager script, in this script you can chnage the maximun bots per party in the variable &quot;Number Of Bots&quot;.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	Cover / Safe Points:</h2>
<p>
	- The AI system count with a simple safe point system, basically this is use for bots to get reference points of where cover in certain situations like when is ramdon walking and get hit by a unkwowing enemy, these points are transforms that you positioned over the map manually.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	Add Cover Points:</h2>
<p>
	- The example level have various AI cover points but when you add a new map, these will be&nbsp;incorrect positions, so you will need to re-positioned it, or if you want add or remove a cover point:</p>
<p>
	Go to the AIManager object in the hierarchy (of the map scene), under this you will see alot of childers called &quot;CoverPoint&quot; so if you want change the positioned just move the transform, you can active the gizmos draw on bl_AICoverPointManager (on AIManager) -&gt; Show Gizmos, if you want a new cover point simple duplicate one of these transforms and ready!</p>

<section id="voice_chat">
	<div class="page-header"><h3>Voice Chat</h3><hr class="notop"></div>
<p>
	From version Beta 6, MFPS 2.0 support Photon Voice for enable team voice chat, for enabling this feature you need a third party plugin <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/45848">Photon Voice</a>, you can download for free from Asset Store.</p>
<p>
	When you have imported it like PUN you need a &#39;App Id&#39; for it, you can get it from your Photon account, more info here:&nbsp;<a href="https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/voice/current/getting-started/voice-for-pun">https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/voice/current/getting-started/voice-for-pun</a></p>
<p>
	After this the feature will be available in game, for default the &#39;<strong>Auto voice detection</strong>&#39; is enable, players can set &#39;<strong>Push to talk</strong>&#39; in the setting menu in game, also can mute the voice chat.</p>
<p>
	For <strong>change the icon</strong> that appear in remote players when this is trasmitting voice, you can do it in bl_DrawName.cs in the player prefabs.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	WebGL</h2>
<p>
	-Due Photon Voice use only UDP, it <strong>can&#39;t be use in WebGL platform</strong> (cuz Web Sockets), and due the asset store pack already have the Photon Voice package if you want export to this platform you need delete the folder &quot;<strong>PUNVoice</strong>&quot;, if you delete this folder and you are not in WebGL in build settings you can get some script compile errors, you fix these switching to WebGL platform.</p>

<section id="game_staff">
	<div class="page-header"><h3>Game Staff</h3><hr class="notop"></div>
<p>	you may want to highlight working game development members with a badge on their behalf for example &quot;Lovatto [Admin]&quot; with a different color that normal players, so other users can see that is a staff member on the game, on MFPS 2.0 there are a simple way to do this and you can set up right on the inspector.</p>
<p>	&nbsp;</p>
<p>	Go to Game Data and find the &quot;Game Team&quot; section:</p>
<p>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_23.png" style="width: 492px; height: 667px;"></p>
<p>	in this list you can add much member as you want, with a simple settings to set up:</p>
<p>	UserName: the name that the staff member need writte to access to this account.</p>
<p>	Role: The staff rank / role on the team.</p>
<p>	Password: when try to sing in with this account name a password window will appear to writte the password (with other names will not appear), so normal player can&#39;t fake identity.</p>

<section id="draw_name">
	<div class="page-header"><h3>Draw Name</h3><hr class="notop"></div>
<p>	In MFPS the player name show to other team players above the head of our player, a simple text, but you can modify the style of this, like color, font, position offset, size,etc...</p>
<p>	simple go to the player prefab (in Resources folder) and on the root object in the script bl_DrawName there are a GUIStyle field called &quot;Skin&quot; if you open this you will see all the gui style options:<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_36.png" style="width: 500px; height: 271px;"></p>
<p>	here you can change the font, text color, size,etc...</p>
<p>	for change the position offset you can do it in the variable called &quot;Content Offset&quot; but for see the result you can do it in run time (with other player from a build and you see from the editor).</p>
<p>	&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	Health Bar.</h2>
<p>	From version r1.0 you can show a health bar above the team mate players, all the logic of this is in <em>bl_DrawName.cs </em>script attached to the player prefabs (above screenshoot), from the inspector of this script you can change the Bar Texture, height and color.</p>
<p>	but if you don&#39;t want to show this health bar you can disable in <strong>GameData </strong>-&gt; ShowTeamMateHealthBar</p>

<p>
	in MFPS bullets are pooled and like all other pooled objects they are listed in <strong>bl_ObjectPooling </strong>script in the GameManager,</p>
<p>
	so in bl_Gun you assign only the &quot;Pooled Name&quot;.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	You may want to add a new bullet for a spesific weapon, let&#39;s say you want add a different Trail Render, well for do it you can do this:</p>
<p>
	- Duplicated a bullet prefab:</p>
<p>

<p>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then make the changes that you want to this prefab and after this add a new field in bl_ObjectPooling (it is attached in GameManager object in room scenes), in the new field drag the bullet prefab and change the pooled name:</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_31.jpg" style="width: 464px; height: 312px;"></p>
<p>
	then open a player prefab and select the <strong>FPWeapon </strong>that you want assign the bullet, in the <strong>bl_Gun </strong>script of that weapon, write the pooled name of the bullet in the field &quot;Bullet&quot;.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_22.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 440px;"></p>

<p>	So first thing you need is Mobile Control,&nbsp;for this there is already an addon specifically for MFPS 2.0, which contains all the necessary buttons, but also you can integrate your prefer system if you want.</p>
<p>	Then you can start to made the optimization work, you should remove the Post-Process effects, you can do it simple remove the script from the Main Camera of player prefabs, MFPS 2.0 disable some systems when is on mobile platforms like weapon smooth movement.</p>
<p>	One of most import thing to do is modify the texture quality, for mobile the maximun size of a image should be 512, more information for mobile optimization can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MobileOptimizationPracticalGuide.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MobileOptimizationPracticalGuide.html</a></p>

<p>	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_2.jpg"  ></p>
<h3>
	Disable Post Processing:</h3>
<p>	Drag player prefabs located in the Resources folder in the scene hierarchy.</p>
<p>	Go to the Main Camera of player prefab (Player -&gt; Heat -&gt; Mouse -&gt; Animations -&gt; MainCamera)</p>

<p>
	MFPS 2.0 have a bunch of features on core, but still missing some important features that almost all FPS have like e.g.: Mini Map, Login System, Level System, Localization, etc... if I tell you that MFPS have all these? yes MFPS have extensions / add ons with which you can integrate all these features.</p>

<p>
	basically it is to maintain a relatively low price for the main core package, if all the addons are added by default the price of the package would rise to at least $250.00 for being a complete set,&nbsp;so we decided to add the essential features to the core and let developers choose which extra extensions they want to integrate.</p>
